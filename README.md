# Netfilx-clone
 This is simple Netflix homepage web designing using HTML and CSS


This project is an attempt to recreate the Netflix homepage using HTML and CSS. I've tried to make it look as close to the real thing as possible. The webpage has sections like "Trending Now" and features movies and TV shows with titles and images, just like on Netflix.
